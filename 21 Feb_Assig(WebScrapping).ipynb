    "There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a)Parsing HTML: Extracting data by parsing HTML directly using libraries such as BeautifulSoup or lxml.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)Using APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow programmatic access to their data, which can be used to extract information in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c)Automated browsing: This involves using browser automation tools such as Selenium to simulate human browsing behavior and extract data from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d)Scraping tools and services: There are several scraping tools and services available that can automate the web scraping process, such as Scrapy and ParseHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e)Reverse engineering: This involves analyzing the structure and behavior of a website to determine how it operates and extract data through various methods, such as network traffic analysis or reverse engineering of mobile apps."

    "Answer:-Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping purposes. It provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface for parsing HTML and XML documents, allowing users to extract data from web pages in a structured format. Beautiful Soup can handle poorly formed HTML and XML documents and can navigate through the parse tree to extract the required data. It is widely used in web scraping projects due to its flexibility, speed, and ability to work with different types of data sources."

    "Answer:-Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework in Python that is commonly used to build web applications. In this web scraping project, Flask can be used to create a web application that allows users to input their search queries and see the scraped data in a user-friendly format. Flask can handle HTTP requests and responses, and can also integrate with various web scraping tools and libraries. By using Flask, developers can create a simple and customizable web interface for their web scraping project without the need for a full-fledged web application framework."
