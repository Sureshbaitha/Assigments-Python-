    "Answer:-Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently within the same process. It is used to achieve parallelism and improve the performance of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks at the same time. The threading module is used to handle threads in Python."
