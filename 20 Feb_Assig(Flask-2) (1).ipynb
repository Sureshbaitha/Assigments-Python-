    "Answer:-The redirect() function in Flask is used to redirect a user to a different URL. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as:\n",
    "(a)After a form submission: After a user submits a form, you may want to redirect them to a \"success\" page to confirm that their submission was received.\n",
    "(b)After a login: After a user logs in, you may want to redirect them to a dashboard or profile page.\n",
    "(c)URL normalization: If a user visits a URL that has multiple possible variations (such as with or without a trailing slash), you can use a redirect to normalize the URL and ensure that all users end up on the same canonical URL.\n",

    "Answer:-\n",
    "In Flask, templates are used to generate dynamic HTML pages that can be customized based on user input and other data. \n",
    "Templates allow developers to separate the presentation logic from the application logic, making it easier to maintain and modify the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to render templates and generate HTML pages dynamically. It takes a template filename as an argument and any additional data needed to generate the page. \n",
    "The function then returns the rendered HTML to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using render_template() allows developers to create HTML templates that can be reused across different pages and routes in the application. \n",
    "It also enables the use of template engines like Jinja2, which provides additional functionality such as control structures, filters, and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, templates and the render_template() function are essential tools in Flask for generating dynamic HTML pages and building scalable web applications."
