An example of API being used in real life is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to integrate Google Maps' functionality into their own applications."

While all Web APIs are APIs, not all APIs are Web APIs. Web APIs are often designed with a RESTful architecture, which emphasizes the use of HTTP verbs and URLs to perform CRUD operations on resources."

REST is a style of software architecture that emphasizes the use of HTTP verbs and URLs to perform CRUD operations on resources. SOAP is a messaging protocol that uses XML to encode messages and can be used to facilitate communication between applications over different networks. A shortcoming of SOAP is its complexity and the overhead involved in parsing XML messages."

REST emphasizes the use of HTTP verbs and URLs to perform CRUD operations on resources and is typically used for building web applications and services.

SOAP is more complex and can be slower than REST, but may be necessary in some cases where more robust messaging is required."
